# Intelligent-data-catalog

Abstract:

Managing the vast and diverse datasets within Bhuvan presents significant challenges in terms of organization and accessibility. In response, the "Intelligent Data Catalogue" project has been initiated to develop a sophisticated data cataloguing service.

Objectives:
a. Organized Inventory: The project seeks to establish a meticulously organized inventory of data assets, creating a comprehensive data catalogue.
b. Automated Tagging and Classification: Leveraging automation techniques and machine learning, the project aims to implement real-time tagging and classification of incoming data, thereby enhancing data governance.
c. Efficient Data Search Mechanism: Our goal is to furnish users with a streamlined data search mechanism, enabling swift access to pertinent datasets.
d. API Integration: By transforming the data catalogue service into an API, we aim to facilitate seamless integration with external services, augmenting the platform's usability and interoperability.

Approach:
Our strategy involves a holistic approach integrating Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for precise data classification and the Flask framework for API development. This strategy serves to optimize data management processes, empower users with efficient search capabilities, and foster seamless integration of Bhuvan's datasets with external services.

Conclusion:
The "Intelligent Data Catalogue" project signifies a comprehensive solution to the intricate data management challenges presented by Bhuvan. By incorporating cutting-edge technologies such as CNN models and the Flask framework, our initiative strives to streamline operations, enhance user experience, and extract valuable insights from Bhuvan's vast datasets.
